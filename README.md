# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-A-Machine-Learning-Approach

### Abstract
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women world-wide. In 2020, there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast can-cer and 685 000 deaths globally. Incidence rates vary widely across theworld, from 27 per 100,000 in Middle Africa and Eastern Asia to 92 per100,000 in Northern America. Earlier detection of this disease can leadto proper treatment. So accurate and fast detection is most important.This proposed paper presents a comparison of six machine learning al-gorithms: XGBoost Classifier, Random Forest, KNN Classifier, LogisticRegression, SVM Classification, Decision Tree on the Wisconsin Diagnos-tic Breast Cancer dataset which is extracted from a digitised image of anMRI. After cleaning the dataset we perform feature scaling. Finally, weapplied those classification algorithm to classifies into two classes‘Ma-lignant  Tumor’, and‘Malignant  Benign’. The best overall accuracy forbreast cancer diagnosis is achieved equal to 93.24% and 94.96% respec-tively using support vector machines classifier and Logistic Regressionmodels against two widely used breast cancer benchmark datasets.
